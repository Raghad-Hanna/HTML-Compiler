what are the entities that constitute a scope?

1-the directives: app, for, if, show, hide, switch & switch-case
we push when we see the directive name and pop when we see the end tag (</tag>)
or the self-closing tag (/>) of any HTML element.

2-the variables: x, x.y, ..
we push whenever we see an identifier (# of members in the expression = # of push operations)
and we pop whenever the expressions ends (# of members in the expression = # of pop operations)
---------------------------------------------
symbols definition in the directives scopes:
-cp_for:
syntax 1: element in array
element is defined in cp_for scope
array is defined in app scope

syntax 2: key, value in object
key, value are defined in cp_for scope
