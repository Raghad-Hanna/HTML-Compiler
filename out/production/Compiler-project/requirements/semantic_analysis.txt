1. Html id attribute MUST be unique on document level.
2. The iterator variable should not repeat.
3. li tag should not be outside ul/ol.
4. Nested cp-app is forbidden.
5. Each html element has at most one structural attribute (one statement) (if/show/hide/for/case).
6. img tag must has src attribute.
7. Anchor tag must has href attribute (anchor tag is <a>).
8. (date) pipe should only receive date format.
9. (currency) pipe should receive one character only.
10. (upper/lower) pipes should not receive any argument.

*Please note there is a possibility to have more pipes, but those are built-in inside our framework.

other requirements:
11. An element start & end tag must match.
12. An element cannot have duplicate attributes.
13. Void elements must have self-closing tag syntax & non-void elements must have an end tag.
14. Parent & child elements relationship must be legal (html, head, body, title, tr besides li).

*Our implementation enforces the specification rule that says HTML elements & attributes are case-insensitive.
(except for the newly-defined directives since they are case-sensitive starting from the syntax analysis phase).
ex: id is equivalent to ID\iD\Id, cp-app is not equivalent to CP-App
